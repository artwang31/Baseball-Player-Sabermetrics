# Baseball-Sabermetrics

Conjured up my inner Billy Beane and found value and baseball efficiency in specific players within a statistical baseball dataset. 

Created my own team, replaced players, and scouted players within a baseball player dataset. Examples of variables I filtered for include, total at bats, total hits, annual salaries, and player injury history.
